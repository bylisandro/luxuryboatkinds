        <h3 class="">Welcome</h3>
        <p>You want to sail across the Pacific Ocean alone - a serious challenge for anyone, even the most experienced.

As skipper, you will probably sleep about three hours/night, at most.

You have to decide: monohull, catamaran or trimaran. Your decision is a matter of which type you have the most experience, you are most comfortable. I’m a monohull sort of guy, but my mother sailed the Med and Caribbean in a cat. So, go with whichever you feel most comfortable.

Length: the boat should be either so small, it will bob up and down with the waves, or big enough to straddle two. What you don’t want is something in-between.

Get a boat that’s unsinkable. Either the hull is made unsinkable, or the boat has lots of built-in buoyancy.

I assume a sail boat, because the Pacific is a bit big for fuel loads.

Simplicity: alone, you will have to do everything, so KISS.

Have lots of backup. Things get wet and things go wrong. Have duplicates, copies, spares and reserves. When my father went off on a long voyage, the downstairs corridor of our house - about 100 metres long, was full of supplies. Offloading from a truck into the yacht took all day. All tins had labels removed and contents written in indelible ink; we had enough to allow being dismasted and adrift for months.

Navigation: we could navigate by all means - coastal, celestial, radio, dead reckoning; now your PC and GPS will do it - but just remember, electronics can go wrong. I also learned to not trust even the best charts - rocks can be quite a way from where claimed.

Be prepared to be scared beyond belief. Even the toughest, most experienced, are known to retreat to the bunk and get blind drunk. The ocean can be a very, very scary place, where at times, there is nothing you can do about it.</p>

          <p>When the owners (I think they were the original family that built Tolly Craft boats) of a new custom 90 foot mega yacht had their boat built in Port Townsend, Wa, by Admiral Marine, they had tunnels built so their cats could get to the litter boxes in a special compartment in the stern. The cats were from the animal shelter.

Admiral Marine had a welding shop that produced stainless steel "jewelry": custom stainless parts; windshields, special lifeline stanchions, custom cleats, davits, etc. etc. It took as more time to smooth and polish the parts as it did to weld them together.</p>

          <p>The most misunderstood directions on a boat or ship are port and starboard. Non-mariners often just equate them to left and right. But they are wrong.There is no left or right side of a vessel, only port and starboard.</p>
